#summary Required prerequisites for using osmdroid.

== Prerequisites ==

=== External libraries ===

osmdroid requires the slf4j-android logging library. If you are using Maven then it will be downloaded for you. If you are using a jar then you must download the slf4j-android library jar from http://www.slf4j.org/android/ and place it in your libs folder.


=== Manifest additions ===

  * You should be targeting the latest API in your project. We support compatibility back to API 4. Your manifest should have a uses-sdk tag similar to:
{{{
<uses-sdk android:targetSdkVersion="16" android:minSdkVersion="4" />
}}}
  * You should turn off hardware acceleration in the manifest. We have experimental HW acceleration support but users will still run into some issues. See issue 413 for more information.
  * osmdroid requires certain permissions in the Android project manifest to perform correctly. You will need to add the following permissions in your manifest file:
{{{
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/> 
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
}}}
