## Map tiles dont seem to load in my application ##

Make sure your AndroidManifest.xml file has the android.permission.INTERNET permission. See [Prerequisites](Prerequisites.md).

## The map will not scroll when I drag my finger on the screen ##

Make sure you don't set the MapView to be "clickable". If you are using xml layouts make sure you **don't** have `android:clickable="true"` or if you are creating your MapView programmatically make sure you **don't** have `mMapView.setClickable(true);`. This should no longer be necessary starting with osmdroid-3.0.11.

## The map is drawing incorrectly/misaligned ##

Turn off hardware acceleration in your manifest. See [Prerequisites](Prerequisites.md).
